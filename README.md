# Air-Hockey-Game
I along with my HackGT team worked on an air hockey simulation/game made only out of python. We used pre-existing python libraries like PyGames to simulate collisions and other physics mechanics within the game. We allowed a player to play the game with their mouse against a hard-coded AI.
The .py file is the main bulk of the code whereas the rest of the files serve as support files to actually flesh out the game.
